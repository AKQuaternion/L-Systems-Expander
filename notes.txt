--------------------------------------------
General
--------------------------------------------
can we make a C++ base class for glut programs? And/or CAVE programs?

How about a camera zoom class based on transvecpos.hpp?

don't forget curve inside penrose tilings

Use this projects parser, context, etc. as master versions

--------------------------------------------
Efficiency
--------------------------------------------
Rulerunner's map of strings (Rulenames) to Cmdconts should be replaced by
a bunch of pointers, but then the RuleCmds in that container need to contain
these pointers, not strings. This is a new thing the Lsystem should hold,
it can be created at syntax check time.

Would it help to make the "top" turtle a member directly? (ie, is stack.top()
inefficient?)

--------------------------------------------
Graphics
--------------------------------------------
handling point streams (which could create other point streams)
(ie, midpoints of all segments, cutting corners, ...)
within turtle class, rulerunner class, or seperately
similarly, will the points list ever have more than one point in it?

rulerunner needs to return draw primitives (ie, segment, etc.) but then
we need some way to combine them for efficiency. Or do we?

Midpoint graphic class isn't stable w/ respect to haveapt being reset. Actually, I don't
think this class works generally at all.

--------------------------------------------
Header file correctness
--------------------------------------------
check const correctness everywhere

typdef all containers

.h files should include only needed header files, forward declaring when necessary

--------------------------------------------
Things to do
--------------------------------------------
when and how to set things like maxdepth or threshold cutoff. I guess in the rulerunner
constructor?

Check a system after reading it to be sure all rules it refers to exist. Similarly
with variables.

rectgraphic

lexer needs a getdatatoken() routine

lexer needs a little help with comment lines. Seems that 
	1) a commented out \ is still not an end of line
	2) lines with nothing but whitespace and then a comment shouldn't get eol after comment
This should be solved by Haskell style layout rules.

Need starting position for turtle. Starting scale, too?

info and startrule are wierd. Info needs to be a system option, and startrule looks like a
rule option but is really a system option. Should also have a way to display the info.

Add ways to interactivly
	make systems inactive or active
	Set drawmethod to or from midpoint

rule option list should just put stuff in a map, and cache for efficiency some values.
Could a Context go back to being just var->double map? I think so. So do syntax 
checking (warnings for rule names that are otherwise reserved (midpoint, drawmethod, etc.))
and this as you read the L-system (or just after, I guess).
Things that don't pass syntax check or otherwise throw while reading should just not
be put in the list...
See Efficiency above.

invis and forward standard rule? Not sure how to handle scaling

How should a context be passed to a rulerunner. By value seems to be inefficient
(copying the whole thing) but by const reference is dangerous unless the user is
careful to not invalidate the context... (Or is it the Context itself that should
be careful to take it's Consttype and Exprtype parts by value?) Given the fact that
we're cacheing values, we can probably pass by const reference, since we never use
it after constructor time!

:: or % to implement rule that doesn't increment depth count
--------------------------------------------
Notes from main.cpp
  //!!!!"class"ify this (wrt a tx, ty translation pair and a sc scale
    //!!!glBegin->glEnd a C++ class constructor destructor resource acquisition?
    } catch (std::exception &error) {
        //!!! Some errors (like can't read config file) are terminal, others we can proceed
        std::cerr << error.what() << std::endl;
    }


--------------------------------------------
Consider parser type any<T> instead of double?
--------------------------------------------


We cache things because they can't be evaluated until parameter value is known, but this seems prone to error. Maybe no cache at all? But then we're parsing every time. Hmmmmm.

"reverse" is really "reflect", yes? At least for users.

Maybe rules with a "start" symbol should go one lever further? (So they don't automatically start with a unit line.)
